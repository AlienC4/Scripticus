#### Running bot locally

You'll need to go [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create your own bot. 
Then in the `Bot` tab, grab the token for the step below

Create `.env` file in the main directory and put your token there: `TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`

You'll also need to create a MongoDB database if you plan to make use of that as well.
